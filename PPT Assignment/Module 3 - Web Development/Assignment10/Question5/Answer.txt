Q.5  What is Mongoose and how does it relate to MongoDB?

Ans - Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that provides a higher-level abstraction over MongoDB. It is designed to simplify the interaction with MongoDB databases and make it easier for developers to define data models and perform database operations in a more structured and intuitive way.

Here's how Mongoose relates to MongoDB:

1. **Abstraction Layer**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents, which can be complex to manage directly using the MongoDB native driver. Mongoose acts as an abstraction layer between the Node.js application and the MongoDB database. It provides a schema-based approach to model the application data, making it easier to define the structure and relationships between different data types.

2. **Schema Definition**: With Mongoose, you define a schema that represents the structure of the data you want to store in MongoDB. A schema defines the fields, types, validation rules, and default values for documents within a collection. By defining a schema, you can enforce data consistency and ensure that data adheres to specific rules.

3. **Model Creation**: Mongoose allows you to create models based on the defined schema. A model represents a collection in MongoDB and provides an interface to interact with that collection. It enables you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data in a more object-oriented manner, using JavaScript functions and methods.

4. **Data Validation**: Mongoose provides built-in data validation. You can specify validation rules for each field in the schema, ensuring that the data being saved to the database meets certain requirements before it is stored. This helps maintain data integrity and prevents invalid data from being inserted.

5. **Middleware**: Mongoose supports middleware, which are functions that can intercept and manipulate the data during various database operations, such as saving or updating a document. This allows you to implement custom logic before or after specific events, like validating data, hashing passwords, etc.

6. **Query Building**: Mongoose simplifies the process of building complex database queries. It provides a fluent and chainable API to create queries, making it easier to filter, sort, and aggregate data in a more expressive way.
